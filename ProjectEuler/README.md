# Project Euler Problems

### Problem 1:

```Python3

"""
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

  if(i % 3 == 0):
    sum += i
  elif(i % 5 == 0):
    sum += i 

print(sum)
  

```

### Problem 2:

```Python3
"""
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Problem 5:

```Python3
""" Project Euler problem #5

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

### Problem 6:

```Python3

""" Project Euler #6
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

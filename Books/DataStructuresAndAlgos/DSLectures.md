### Collections

* COLLECTION

* Collection is an object that gather/organizes other objects(elements)

* Many types of fundamental collections include stacks queues lists trees graphs and are broadly categorized as linear or nonlinear

* Elements in a collection are usually based on when they were added or possibly some type of relationship among the elements

* The type of collection you use depends on what you want to accomplish

* ABSTRACTION

* An abstraction hides certain details at certain times, and provides a way to deal w/ the complexity of  asystem.  

* A collection like any well defined object is an abstraction

* E.g. you can say car engine and most people know what you're talking about, the opposite of an abstraction is detail

* We want to separate the interface of the collection(how we interact with it) from the underlying details of how we choose to implement it.  E.g. A well define dinterface masks the implementation of the collection

 * TERMS

 * The terms used for collections are used a variety of ways

 * Data type: A group of values and the ops defined on those values

 * Abstract data type: A data type whose values/operations are not inherently defined in a language

 * data structure: The programming constructs used to implement a collection

 * STACK COLLECTION

 * LIFO(Last In First Out)

 * Elements can only be added on the top of the stack and removed from the top of the stack

 * Stacks are used when you want to go through things sequentially

 * COLLECTION OPERATIONS

 * Every collection has a set of ops that defines how we interact with it including: adding/removing elements, length of the collection, etc...

 * STACK OPERATIONS

 * Stack operations include: push(add), pop(remove), peek(examine element at the top of the stack), isEmpty(Determines if the stack is empty), size(determines # of elements in the queue)

* INHERITANCE

* In OOP inhertiance means to derive a class from the definition of another class.  

* Inheritance is usually easier/faster/cheaper, and is at the heart of software reuse.  

* In software a mamal class would have vars/method that describe the state/behavior of mammals, and from that class we could derive a horse or a dog class that would inhereit variables/methods from the mammal class, and the horse/dog class could have variables/methods of their own. 

* The original class that is used to establish a new class is known as the parent class, super class, or base class.  

* This derivation is known as an IS-A relationship(e.g. a hore IS A mammal)



* POLYMORPHISM

* Polymorihic means that the variable can refer to different types of objects at different points in time

* The specific method invoked by a polymorphic refrence can change from one invocation to the next.  

* Polymorphism calls for dyanmic binding which means that the binding cannot occur until runtime.

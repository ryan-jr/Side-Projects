# Java Software Structures

* Collections/a collection is an object that gathers/organizes other objects

* Elements within the collection aretypcially organized by the order of theier additon or by some relationship among the elements

* An abstraction hids certain details at certain times.  Interfaces allow access to the abstraction in some way(e.g. a car engine is controlled by the ignition, and the throttle(the interfaces)

* Data types are a group of values and the operations defined on those values.  An Abstact data type is a data type whose values and operations are not inherently defined in the programming language

* A data structure is the underlying programming construct used to implement a collection.  

* A stack collection operates in LIFO and includes push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and size.  

* Inheritance is the process of deriving a new class from an exsisting one and is key for software reuse.  Inheriticed variables/methods can be used in a derived class as if they had been declared locally.

* Inheritance creates an IS-A relationship between all parent/child classes.  (A horse IS A mammal)

* We can create class hierarchies in which the child of one class, can be the parent of another class, with common features being as high up as possible. 


*** WHAT IS POLYMORPHISM ***???!!!

* Polymorphic refrences use the type of object not the type of reference to determine which version of a method to invoke.

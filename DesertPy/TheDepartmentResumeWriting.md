# The Department Resume Review / Resume Writing Tips

* Forbes is awesome!

* Techtalent south, Coding bootcamp out of Charolette since NOV

* Figure out what job you're going for.

* Finding someone and asking them out to coffee is totally fine

```
What should I do, how did you get here, what skills do you have, etc...



```

* Look at job postings (12+) w/ same job title, and find the keywords.

* Make sure that you get automated leads generated via the job boards (ZIPRecruiter, indeed, monster, etc...)

* Know what the job pays, what the duties are, and what the minimum qualifications are.

* Knowing the above 3 gives you a context of what you're getting into (Use glassdoor etc.. to get an idea of the pay, also BLS, etc...)

* Don't bring up pay until they do, when they talk $$$ they put the ball in your court, and hope you undervalue yourself.  Find the pay that and add $5k

* Know what is going to be asked of the position, and what will be asked of you and what you can do.  

* Your resume is an argument, think of it like a baseball card that has stats on it, and use it to support your arg

* The more specific the resume is/the better tailored it is, the better of an arg it is.

* There can be tradeoffs between formatting and content.

* The resume needs to be one page

* Cut EVERYTHING that is not related to the job

* Don't LIE

```

* Name, address, and contact info(Portfolios and linkedin are part of contact info)

* Some people read a topline sentence, some people don't.  

* Education second

* Relevant experience
- Put things in reverse chornological order
- Should be the format of:
JOB TITLE, PLACE, DATES(generally)(But use what you can and keep it consistent)

* Relevant Accolades 

```

* Make the job easier for the person on the other end, assume you have to do all the work

* Optimize yourself for SEO, use power words/words that directly relate to the job

* Interweave your story part and the coreskills throughout the resume

* Be consistent in the resume(In terms of spacing, fonts, etc...)

* The more you can do in a paragraph format, can give you more room to separate yourself from bullet points.

* Look at all your experience when you decide how to structure your resume

* List duties and qualifications (What's expected in the job and what is needed to meet that duty)


```
EX:

Duties:
- Loan Qualifications
- Credit Reports

Qualifications:
- 5 years exp
- Associates degree



```

* Each of the above comes out in different parts of the resume and makes sure that you're not repeating yourself. Repeating yoruself is wasting space.  

* These duties/quals are filters for us in the resume as well as in the cover letter and in LinkedIn

* Cover letter Format

```
Intro

Each body paragraph can be a different duty/qualification that you've had that meets
Body 1 
Body 2
Body 3
Conclusion
``` 

* Think of each of the qualifications as a piece that you need to meet

* If they say something in the job posting, meet it in your resume/explanation.  (They ask for X, put X somewhere in your resume, where X is a keyword/phrase)

* If duties are super specific, they probably care about it.  If it's super general/long, they probably don't care as much.  

* If a job posting is failing you, use other job postings as a guide.  

* Linkedin is one big resume, if you do an export of your profile

* Yourlinked should be your extended resume, and your headline should be as straightforward as possible.

* Add everyone you meet on linked in, and add a note. 

* Professionally brag on linked in/post, it's OK

* Every duty/qual is them askign a question: Can you meet this qualifcation, and can you do this duty if I hire you?

* Making it easy for HR

```
1.  Don't make it look like a ton of stuff is on the resume 

2.  Make the font/spacing consistent

3.  Have some bold here/there to break things up

4.  OK to add certs/bootcamps in education

5.  Have the keywords down, b/c automation is the first thing is there

6.  Make sure that all the contact info is at the top

7.  The next thing that sets you apart is the cover letter, which is just an argument in a different form.  (Why I should get this job over everyone else)

8.  An HR rep should be able to read what you have under your job/job title/job description and have a picture in their head of what you did

```



* Bullet points versus paragraphs is a personal choice.  If you need to take up space use bullets, but if you want to make a more nuanced arg use paragraphs

* Cover letter Essay outline

```

You can Google, business professional letter


Know duties/qualifications

Intro Para: Like a handshake.  Intro line should be something like "to whom it may concern I think I would be a great fit for your company".

Thesis: Key/main arg(I should get this job because of my expreience w/ A, my mastery of B, and this thing I did w/ C).  

A.Explain how you meet X duty/qualification here

B.  Explain/thread through how you meet 



Concluding sentence can be w/ next intro is

This is only part of the reason why I'm the best fit for this job, The other reason why I'm the best fit for this job is...


Closing: Thank you for your time

```


* To mass produce a cover letter: 

```
While edoing yoru research, you'll find that job titles are similar but have slightly different duties/qualifications



Some people have 12 different resumes to meet these all the quals/duties in different asks
```

* Quick crash course of interview prep

```
1.  Google the company and have some BG on them

2.  Bring a suggestion on what they might do better

3.  Dress for the job, SHOW UP ON TIME

4.  Bring questions to ask

5.  Imposter syndrome is where you're underqualified, but where you're faking it but you can't/don't feel like you can make it.  To avoid this, make sure you know what you're getting into.

6.  NETWORKING IS KEY

7.  Linked, having your cellphone is OK.

8.  Having generic biz cards is good/OK.

```

* DO a lot of research time/prep time and then apply to a bunch of jobs

* If the job is available at a lot of companies, then shotgun resumes, the more specific it is then it probably trends more towards networking/linkedin stuff

* It doesn't hurt to go to networking stuff

```



### 1.  Prep Work

* Know the job you're going for

* Once you have the above figure out understand that there will be several job titles out there that will be similar(e.g developer, associate developer, Jr. developer, etc...)

* Get a good idea of the requirements(e.g. what you will have to do/perform on the job) and qualifications(what you need in order to do the job), these will be guidelines for everything you will template out and help guide you in how you write/structure your resume

* Every duty/qualifcation is asking the questions: Can you do this duty if I hire you? and Can you meet this qualification?

* Start getting automated leads for the job you want by subscribing to email lists via indeed, zip recruiter, monster, etc... this gets jobs coming to you.

* Do research on what the job pays/minimum expected salary (Use glassdoor, BLS, etc... to get this)

* NOTE: Don't bring up $$$ until they do, this puts the ball in your court(They're hoping you'll undervalue yourself).  Find the pay that you want and add $5k.


### 2.  The Resume

* Think of the resume that you're going to build as an argument, and the cover letter as a longer extension of that argument, and both of them support the argument that you're the best person for this job

* The more specific the resume is/the more tailored it is, the stronger the argument is.

* In the resume, the tradeoffs are usually between formatting and content(e.g. bullet points or paragraphs)

* THE RESUME NEEDS TO BE ONE PAGE

* Cut out ANYTHING that isn't related to the job you want.  

* DON'T LIE

* Resume Outline:

```
* Topline(s): Name, address, contact info(Portfolios and linkedin are part of contact info)

* Optional: Topline/summary sentence

* Education

* Relevant experience
- Put things in reverse chronological order
- Use the general(and consistent!) format of: Job Title, Place, Date(s)

* Relevant Accolades

```

* All of the above is done at the very least to assume that the person on the other end reading your resume is trying to make it as easy as possible on themselves, meaning that you have to do/should do that much more work

* Optimize yourself for SEO/keyword searches, so use power words/words that directly relate to the job

* Since your resume is telling a story, weave this story all through the resume

* BE CONSISTENT IN YOUR RESUME(in terms of spacing, fonts, etc...)

* You can fit more in a paragraph format word wise, but if you need to use/take up space use bullet points

* Look at all of your experience when deciding how you want to structure/craft your resume

* Take the list of duties/qualifications that you did in prep work and use it to guide your resume/as a guideline for what to include/what is most crucial:

```
Example:

Job Title: Underwriter

Duties:
- The job candidate will perform loan qualifications
- The job candidate will analyze credit reports

Qualifications:
- 5 years experience
- Associates degree

```

* Each of the above should come up/be answered in different parts of the resume.

* Make sure that you don't repeat yourself in the resume, otherwise you're wasting space



### 3.  The Cover Letter

* Cover Letter Format

```
Intro

* NOTE: Each body paragraph can/should be a different job/responsibility you've had that meets one(or more) of the duties/qualifications

Body 1
Body 2
Body 3

Conclusion

```

* If they say something in the job posting, meet it in your resume/explanation(e.g. If they ask for X, put X somewhere in your resume/cover letter, where X is a keyword/phrase)

* Cover letter Essay outline

```

You can Google, business professional letter


Know duties/qualifications

Intro Para: Like a handshake.  Intro line should be something like "to whom it may concern I think I would be a great fit for your company".

Thesis: Key/main arg(I should get this job because of my expreience w/ A, my mastery of B, and this thing I did w/ C).  


Concluding sentence can be w/ next intro is

This is only part of the reason why I'm the best fit for this job, The other reason why I'm the best fit for this job is...

A.  Explain how you meet X duty/qualification here

B.   Explain how you meet X duty/qualification here

C.   Explain how you meet X duty/qualification here


Closing: Thank you for your time

```


* To mass produce a cover letter: 

```
While doing your research, you'll find that job titles are similar but have slightly different duties/qualifications

When you construct the paragraphs, it's generally mix/match from there

Some people have 12 different resumes to meet these all the quals/duties in different asks
```

4.  Linkedin

* Think of Linkedin as one big long/in depth resume, it has your full history on there

* Make your linkedin headline as straightforward/to the point as possible

* Add everyone you meet on linkedin, and send them a note(e.g. if you'd like to meet them for coffee etc...)

* It's OK to brag about your professional life on linked in, it's also OK to post professional articles etc... that you find interesting on linked in


### 5.  Making it Easy for HR


```
1.  Don't put a TON of stuff on your resume or make it look like it's a tough/hard/long/challenging read

2.  Make the font/spacing consistent

3.  Use bold occasionally here and there to break things up

4.  It's OK to have bootcamps/certs under education(as long as you can converse about something you learned from it)

5.  Have the keywords in there, because automation will be the first thing that will happen

6.  Make sure that all the contact info is at the top

7.  The cover letter can help set you apart

8.  An HR rep should be able to read what you have under your job title/description and have a picture in their head of what you did

```

6.  Other Odds and Ends


* If a job posting is failing you, use other/similar job postings as a guide

* If duties are specific, they probably care about it.  If it's a general list of duties/qualifications, they probably don't care as much/emphasize it as much.


* Quick crash course of interview prep

```
1.  Google the company and have some BG on them

2.  Bring a suggestion on what they might do better/an improvement

3.  Dress for the job, SHOW UP ON TIME

4.  Bring questions to ask

5.  Imposter syndrome is where you're underqualified, but where you're faking it but you can't/don't feel like you can make it.  To avoid this, make sure you know what you're getting into.

6.  NETWORKING CAN HELP

7.  Linked, having your cellphone is OK.

8.  Having generic biz cards is good/OK.

```

* DO a lot of research time/prep time and then apply to a bunch of jobs

* If the job is available at a lot of companies, then shotgun resumes, the more specific it is then it probably trends more towards networking/linkedin stuff

* It doesn't hurt to go to networking stuff

# Find a Job

## Step 1: Find job descriptions for roles you'd want to apply for

* Goal: Find 10 companies and 5 Job Descriptions that you want to apply for


```

Homework 
 
Find 5 job descriptions. Make a copy of the "CNC2018 Get A Job - Job Descriptions" doc and fill it out.
 
 Instructions 

Let’s find 5 job descriptions. Ideally, these five descriptions are jobs you can actually apply for. The goal isn’t to match 100% of the job description, but to match enough of it that it makes sense to pursue.

 1  Look at the job boards from the 10 companies you listed in part 1 and see if you can find a few jobs you’d like to apply for. If you’re not finding open positions at those companies, use the job search tools below (from part 1) to find positions.  

Job Search Tools: 
Boards like Indeed.com, SimplyHired, and Dice
If you have a local Chamber of Commerce, check their listings and events. They often promote the tech sector.
For startups, check out local startup communities like BuiltInLa.com and the NYTech Meetup. Look at job boards from VC firms, like Y Combinator jobs and USV jobs. AngelList also has a great job board.
For remote jobs, check out WeWorkRemotely, RemoteOk, and Remotive.io
 2  Copy and paste at least 5 job descriptions you found into your copy of the "CNC2018 Get A Job - Job Descriptions" doc.

 3  Parse through the job descriptions As you go through each job description, extract the key information listed below (technologies, skills, responsibilities, background) and add it to your copy of the "CNC2018 Get A Job - Job Descriptions" doc in the corresponding section.
 
Technologies
What technologies are mentioned in the job description? This might include languages, frameworks, tools, or methodologies. Make a note of these in your doc.

Skills
What skills does it mention? There might be some overlap with the Technologies but there are likely non-technical skills mentioned as well. Make note of these in your doc.

Responsibilities
What are the responsibilities of this role? Sometimes, there’s a “responsibilities” section of the job description. Otherwise, find the sentences that discuss what you’d actually do in this role.

Background/Experience/Qualifications
What experience do they expect you to have? Sometimes, there’s a section called “Background”, “Experience”, or “Qualifications.” Otherwise, look for sentences that start with something like “You should have …” or “The ideal candidate has experience ….” to guide you.

If there are other key terms that come up, notes you want to take, or if the job description mentions "preferred, but not required" skills, make note of these in the doc.
 
 4  Evaluate your 5 job descriptions. How well do they match your current skills and abilities? Put these job descriptions into one of three categories: reach, target, safety. These categories are meant to asses how close a match you are to the ideal candidate for that position.
 
Reach
You’re less than a *50% match. It would be tough to get, but there's nothing wrong about aiming high!

Target
You’re about a *70% match. You’ve got a pretty good shot at a role like this!

Safety
You’re a *90%+ match. This job sounds like it's made for you. You’re confident you can get a job like this.

If all of your job descriptions are in the "Reach" category, we might need to do some more research. On the other hand, if all your job descriptions are in the "Safety" category, it might be a good idea to reach higher. Having a good number of "Target" roles is a good bet that you'll be pushing yourself in that role, while still being a solid candidate.

*The percentages listed are very subjective and it’s tough to evaluate yourself. If you’re not sure how to categorize your job descriptions, reach out to a developer friend or use the Facebook Group to get some feedback from the community.

 5  Let's review your final 5 job descriptions. How do you feel? Are you pumped to apply? Discouraged? Do you want to do more research? Jot down your thoughts and reflections in your “Job Description” doc. Use the Facebook Group (password: New Year, New Moves) to share where you are and don’t be shy about asking for help.

### Step 2: Update your LinkedIn Profile


* Make your online persona reflect your job goals


* (https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-create-a-portfolio-site-that-will-get-you-hired/)[Useful Links]

```

Homework 
 
Update three key items on your LinkedIn profile.

Note: These instructions assume you're pursing a code-related job. If you're not, simply replace the code stuff with whatever skill/industry your job search is focused on.
 
 Instructions 

Your LinkedIn profile is a work in progress. As you continue with your job search, talk to developers, and gather more information on what employers are looking for, you’ll come back to make edits and updates. This is your first update, but it probably won’t be your last.

 1  HEADLINE 
Present a specific, code-focused professional title

Regardless of your background, your coder identity needs to be front and center. Employers want to see that you describe yourself as a coder, so it’s ok to claim the “developer” title before you land your first job. The LinkedIn headline is a personal branding space that may or may not match your exact job title. Do you have Ruby skills? Do you make Ruby things? Great! You’re a Ruby Developer. Put that in your LinkedIn headline. Not sure which title to use? Generally, “[programming language] developer” is appropriate for beginner coders. Engineer is more suitable for those with advanced skills. But look at your job description research and the roles you found from last week's mission to inform your decision. The better you're able to match how those posts describe the role you're going for, the more likely you are to show up in a recruiter's search. For step-by-step instructions on editing your profile, go here.

 2  SUMMARY 
Make your coding skills highly visible

Make sure your summary is focused on the kinds of jobs you're going for, even if you don’t have any paid experience yet. Use those five job descriptions from your last mission. Look at the key terms, technologies, and skills that show up most often. Can you incorporate them into your summary? Keep it skimmable. Be honest, and be specific.
 
 3  PORTFOLIO/PROJECTS
Highlight your completed projects
 
Projects are a great way to demonstrate your skills and potential, especially when you don't have much work experience. Show employers what you’re capable of by adding a link to your portfolio or GitHub page. Great projects demonstrate measurable outcomes. So make sure to describe what the project is, what tools and technologies you used to create it, and highlight a few technical challenges you had to overcome. We’ll do a more detailed mission on portfolios later, so use this as an opportunity to gather a few projects and give them a home on your LinkedIn profile. Here’s how to add a website to your LinkedIn profile.

 EXAMPLES 
Looking for the right words to describe your skills? Check out these profiles from developers at different skill levels and from different backgrounds to get you started:
Web development: Shiju Daniel, Karishma Tiwari, Antoin Campbell, Joseph Redden Williams IV
Mobile development: Izza Nadeem, Brian Gould, Steve Suranie, Lauren Roth
 TIPS 

It's all about keywords. Talking about your new skills may feel awkward at first, but you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Employers are using algorithms to locate candidates by keyword, so go ahead and be blunt about the essentials: Which language do you use? Which frameworks? What have you built? Use this list of top keywords or this list of skills for developers to get you started.
 Bonus Mission: Profile Photo

Picking your profile picture can be stressful. Let’s cover the basics. Clean hair. Neutral makeup. Good posture. Simple background. And make sure it’s a headshot where we can actually see your face. That’s going to be good enough for most employers.

Not sure how formally to dress? Look at the LinkedIn profiles of employees at one of the top companies you’d like to join and steal some of their styling choices. Make sure your photo is less than 5 years old. Bam! Done.

```

### Step 3: Talk about Yourself

* Goal: Practice discussing your skills and learn about opportunities

* Useful Links: (Developer Networking Tips)[https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/developer-networking-tips/], (The Software Developer's Guide to Networking)[https://simpleprogrammer.com/software-developers-networking/], (Youtube: 3 Easy Ways to start a conversation with anyone)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbyc7mscFlA], Youtube: (Ways to network without being fake)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkqd6T399tQ]



```
Homework 
 
Practice talking about your technical skills and discover companies and opportunities that might interest you by attending one tech or coding event. 
 
 Instructions 

 1  Search for a coding or tech event near you. Here are a few sites to get your search started:
Meetup.com -- search for “tech”, “coding”, “programming”, “developer”
Girl Develop It -- they offer classes, but also have local meetups and events to connect with other developers
Women Who Code -- international events and meetups on different technical topics
CodeNewbie Meetups -- community coding and mixers in DC and Philadelphia
FreeCodeCamp study groups -- find a local study group hosted all over the world
No events near you? Find an online community where you can converse with coders, like our CodeNewbie Slack and these online CodeBuddies Events.

 2  Register for one event. Mark the time and place of your chosen event in your calendar, and set a reminder for when it’s time to leave. Leave yourself plenty of time to get ready to make a great first impression. If there are no upcoming in-person events, set aside time to join and actively participate in an online group.
 
 3  Prepare for your event. Your goals for the event are to practice talking about yourself and to get more information about job opportunities and companies. Here’s how to prepare:

Make a copy of this “Networking Notes” doc and write down the name and date of the event.

Prepare a short pitch (2-3 sentences) about yourself as it relates to your coding goals and write it in your copy of the doc. Your goal is to present yourself as a great candidate for a possible position, so craft your story with that goal in mind.

For example, if you’ve been working as a high school English teacher and you’ve recently made the switch to coding, you might be tempted to say something like this: “I was a high school English teacher for ten years and learned how to code about seven months ago. I’ve been learning JavaScript through an online program, and I’m currently looking for my first position.” This isn’t a bad pitch, but it frames you as a student who’s hoping for their first break. When looking for a job, you want to present yourself as job ready.

Instead, try rearranging it to something like this: “I’m currently a developer, hoping to get a new role working with JavaScript. Before that, I actually taught high school English for ten years.” This pitch frames you as a developer with an interesting story, a past life that makes you stand out among other potential candidates.

Even better, throw in a sentence or two that connects your past life with being a developer, like this version: “I’m currently a developer, hoping to get a new role working with JavaScript. Before that, I actually taught high school English for ten years. Being a high school teacher has helped me so much as a developer, especially when figuring out really tough problems. If you can figure out how to make a bunch of rowdy teenagers settle down and care about grammar, you can take on any bug!”

No matter what your past life was, there is always a way to connect what you did with what you’re doing in a way that presents your past as an asset. Think about how your past career gave you problem-solving skills, communication skills, built up your patience, persistence, resilience, and empathy. Find a way to explain that connection in your pitch in a short example, a story, or a few sentences. And always lead with the fact that you are now a developer.

Short stories (3) Think of the technical and professional skills that showed up most frequently during your job description search. Of those skills, pick the ones you want to highlight in your conversations. Jot those down in your copy of the “Networking Notes” doc.

Now think of three stories that demonstrate that you have those skills. For technical skills, you might want a story about a project you worked on, a bug you squashed, or an idea you have for a future project. For soft skills, think about a time when you displayed strong communication, teamwork, or problem-solving skills. If it makes sense to focus on your knowledge or experience in a particular industry, think of a time when you worked with, or for, a big name in your field. Each story should be told in a few sentences and clearly demonstrate the skills that the job you want is looking for.

Your goal in preparing these short stories is to see what people are interested in, what they ask questions about, and what you can do to better communicate your abilities in the future to potential employers. So pick stories that you’re proud of to see if it resonates with others. You might also want to pick a few examples that you’re unsure of, and test them out at the event to see what how people react.

Make a list of questions you want to ask and information you hope to get at the event. To come up with this list, see if the event has a guest list and take a look at who else will be there. If they have a hashtag, see who has used it before the event. Make note of who the organizers are and who’s hosting the event. If there are speakers, look them up. Use this information to find people you want to connect with, and think about what you want to learn from them. If there are developers from a company on your list, you might want to ask them what it’s like to work there. If there’s someone with a similar background as you, want might want to ask how they landed their first job. If there are sponsors at the event, they’re most likely recruiting. See what jobs they have available and connect with them at the event. Going to an event with a clear mission, questions to ask, and a short list of people you want to meet can help you make the most out of your time there. Jot these questions down in your doc.

 4  At the event, participate in at least two distinct conversations. Don’t worry, we’ll show you how to get started in the “How to network” section below. This can be with two different groups or two individuals. While you converse, make note of what follow up questions they ask, what they’re excited about, and what they’re interested in. On the other hand, pay attention to things that confuse them or moments when they seem uninterested. If you meet anyone you want to follow up with, make sure to ask for their card. If they don’t have one (and most developers probably won’t), make sure to jot down their contact. If they’re on twitter, getting their handle is also helpful because then you’ll have their photo and more context on them, making it easier to remember who they are after the event. Make sure you have something take notes with, whether it’s your phone or a notebook.

 5  Review your performance. Once you get back home, take a few minutes to reflect, and write down the following:
What are three things that you said when talking about yourself that worked really well? Make sure to use them in the future.
 
What are three things you said that did not work. Why do you think they didn’t resonate? What might you change about your story, or should you replace it altogether?
 
What are three people/companies/ideas you connected with that you want to follow up on? Any potential job opportunities you want to look into?
 
  PROTIP 

Trust that people love talking about themselves. I host three podcasts, I would know. You don’t need to have a perfect elevator pitch in order to make meaningful connections. Whenever possible, ask open-ended questions (ones that can’t be answered with yes/no). Ask a lot of “how do you feel about” and “what has your experience of ___ been like”? If you’re not sure where to start, or worried about getting too technical, check out the latest tweets from Recode or TechCrunch. Read two or three tech news articles before you attend an event. Ask people if they’ve heard about the news and have opinions on it.
 How To Network

A. CONVERSATION SKILLS FOR IN-PERSON EVENTS

Start a 1-to-1 conversation
Find spaces where people congregate, often near food
Make eye contact, then introduce yourself
Try “Hey, I don’t think I’ve met you yet. I’m Ashley.”
Provide easy opening topics
"Hi, I’m Sofia. What brings you to WWDC18?”
"Hello, I’m Kiara. How long have you been working in tech?”
Drive the conversation toward opinions and feelings about one thing you’re guaranteed to have in common: the event!
“Hi, I’m Maria. What do you think of the talks so far?”
“Hi, I’m Sandra. It’s my first time here, what about you?”
“Hey, I’m Alex. Do you come to these meetups often?“
 
Join a group conversation
Approach near an opening in the circle. If the group momentarily stops speaking and looks your way, introduce yourself. “Hey everyone! I’m Jerome. How’s everyone liking the event so far?”
 
If the group does not stop conversing and acknowledge you, make eye contact when you can. If there’s someone who looks disengaged from the group, they’re the perfect person to start a side conversation with. Try and catch their eye and start with, “So have you been here before?”
 
Once you have identified the group’s discussion topic, contribute positive comments. These small gestures can alert people to your presence in a low key way. They’re often single-word responses: 
“Neat!”
“Congratulations!”
“Interesting!”
 
Interject with short questions to the main person speaking in the group, like:
“How did you do that?”
“When did that happen?”
“How did you come up with that?”
 
If there’s space for a longer interjection, engage with the main speaker by asking for more information. 
“You know, that’s really interesting. I’ve always wondered how that works. Can you tell me more about how you did that?”
“How long have you been part of that project/company?”
“Sounds like you love your job. What’s the best part?”
“That’s an impressive project. How did you get started?”
Gracefully exit a conversation
Start with a thank-you if you can.
“Thanks for sharing that. There are so many people here! I should make the rounds. Talk to you again soon!”
“I loved hearing about how you got started in tech, that’s really inspiring. I’m so glad I got to meet you. Alrighty, time to meet some more awesome folks!”
 
Add forward momentum with one of these strategies.
Ask them if they know anyone else here that they could introduce you to.
“Do you know anyone else here I should try to connect with?” Then after they mention a name, you can either ask for an intro: “Neat! Would you mind introducing me?” or say, “Thanks so much! Let me go introduce myself.”
Introduce them to someone else who might share their interests.
“You should meet Maria, she also came from advertising. Can I introduce you?”
Mention another event that you’re attending. “Thanks for a great conversation, Bill. I’ve got to go, but I’ll be attending DevCon Georgia in a couple weeks. If you can make it, I hope to see you there!”
Escape an awkward conversation
“Candice, it was so good meeting you. I’m starving! I’m going to go grab some food.”
“Thanks for sharing your views. Oh, my gosh, it’s 9 already? I’ve got to go make a quick call.”
"Interesting. Do you know where the restroom is?"
 
B. ONLINE CONVERSATIONS

Within your selected Slack community, search for channels related to employment. Look for terms like job hunting, hiring, careers, and freelance.
Join a channel. Add comments on other people’s posts to join a conversation, or ask a question to start a new conversation thread.
Search for Slack channels on coding topics that interest you.
Add comments on other people’s posts to join a conversation, or ask a question to draw people into a conversation of value to you.
“Has anyone here used Angular to make ___?
“Has anyone ever tried [insert new tool]?”
 
Once you’ve found two people with either interests or career paths that are similar to yours, use direct messages to privately ask those individuals about their employment aspirations and experiences, and share more about your story.
 PROTIPS 
Whether in person or at event, don't explicitly ask people for a job. If you know there are open positions at their company, ask them about the interview process, how you can apply, or what you can do to increase your chances of getting the position, but don't ask them to hire you on the spot.
 
When communicating online, be careful not to overwhelm people. Don’t send pages of your life story to a complete stranger. That much detail is better over coffee or on a call, so if you’re able to go from DMs to real-time communication, that's the time to share more details. For online communication, keep the conversation casual and individual messages succinct.

```

### Step 4: Contacts

* Goal: Find five contacts at your favorite companies and reach out to them

```

Homework 
 
Look at your top 10 companies from earlier in this challenge and find five people (total) at those companies that you’d like to connect with. Aim to set one meeting for next week. Make a copy of this “Five Contacts” doc and fill it in.
 
 Instructions 

 1  Review your list of the 10 companies that you’re excited about.

 2  Find contact information for at least one employee at each company that you might want to connect with. Use LinkedIn, Twitter, TenThousandCoffees.com and company homepages to search for the names of employees who hold jobs that you aspire to or would like to learn more about. This could be a junior employee, or someone who manages a technical team. Use your network, like your past jobs, college, university, or coding program to help you connect.
 
 3  Narrow your list down to five people who you think would be most likely to connect with you. There are a few ways things to consider. If they’re an executive, they’re probably too busy to connect sometime soon. If they’re a junior, they might be more available and more excited to help you out. Also take a look at their community involvement through their blog, twitter, Slack groups, or other online activity. If they’ve shown that they’re willing to help others, particularly newbies, they’re more likely to take some time to connect with you. Pick the top five that are most likely to connect with you and highlight them in your copy of the “Five Contacts” doc.

 4  Prepare what to say when you reach out. Write down a few lines you can use in a phone call or email. Mention your name, their name, why you’d like to speak with them, and ask for 20 minutes of their time. Aim for an in-person informational interview. If that’s not possible, then try to schedule a video or phone call. Use the scripts below to help you structure your request.

Before you reach out, it is important to have your questions ready and to have done your research on them first. Making your request specific and showing that you’ve done your homework will make them more likely to respond and connect. 

 5  Reach out to your top five. Find a way to actually connect with your top five. Reach out to your network to see who might be able to give you a warm introduction. Intros are better than cold emails, so try that approach first. Next, see if you can find their email address. Usually, their GitHub profile or personal website has contact information, so check that out. If there’s nothing there, then see if their DMs are open on Twitter or if you can message them on LinkedIn. If you happen to be in the same Slack groups, Meetup groups, or other organizations, see if you can reach out to them there. I’ve included some scripts below on what to say in your first message.

 6  Follow up. If they don’t respond the first time, that’s ok! People get busy, they miss emails, they thought they responded but didn't. The only thing you know for sure is that it’s time to follow up! Wait at least 3-4 days before sending a follow-up email. Use the example email listed below. If someone rejects your request, try someone else in their department. It’s a numbers game. Not everyone will have time to speak with you, but if you keep trying, you’ll find someone who does! 

 7  Schedule three informational interviews, with at least one for next week. Make scheduling super easy for them. Have a few dates and times ready when they respond, suggest a location, and send a cal invite. Saying things like, “I’m available whenever!” is not helpful. It puts the burden on them to figure out when to meet. Instead, say something like, “I’m available whenever! How’s next Thursday afternoon, maybe 3PM EST in midtown?”
 Example Scripts
 
Here are a few scripts you can use when reaching out to people. Put your own spin on it, but make sure to be straightforward and to the point.

Example email 1 “I’m a fan”
“Hi [name], I’m [name], a [current job] and I’m transitioning into the tech industry. I saw that you [name their role or a project they have mentioned on social media] and I’m interested in hearing more about [some specific topic you’d like to discuss]. Would you be able to meet with me for coffee? I’m sure you’re busy, so even 20 minutes would be appreciated.”

Example email 2 “I’ve done my research"
“Hi [name], I’m [name], a [current job] and I’m working towards [your career goal]. I’ve been reading up on [research you’ve done that's related to your request] and wanted to connect with you about [topic you hope to discuss with them]. Would you be up for coffee sometime in the next few weeks? I’d really appreciate it!”

Example email 3: “I’m stuck”
“Hi [name], I’m [name], a [current job] and I’m hoping to [your career goal]. I’ve been trying to figure out [career related problem or question you hope to discuss with them] and I’ve been having a really tough time. I was hoping you might give me some insight on [the topic they can help you with]. Are you available for coffee sometime in the next few weeks? I’d really appreciate your help.”

Example email 4: "I'm curious about your work"
“Hi [name], I’m [name], a [current job] in [city]. I’m reaching out because I’m researching careers in [desired role or department] and would love to learn more about your role. Would you be able to meet with me for coffee? I’m sure you’re busy, so even 20 minutes would be appreciated."

Follow up email example (reply to your first email, don’t send a new email)
“Hi [name], I just wanted to follow up on this. Any chance you’re available to connect next week? If you prefer a quick phone conversation, even 20 minutes would be appreciated. Thank you!”

```



### Step 5: Meet and Greet

* Meet with a contact and talk over them

```

Homework 
 
Informational interviews are great opportunities to find out what companies are looking for in a junior developer. It's also a great way to practice pitching yourself.

Doing informational interviews is like going on a bunch of blind dates before you finally meet your match. By the time you do receive an invite to a job interview, your pitch will be well-honed, familiar, and more comfortable. It will be easier for you to be fully present, and that engagement shows.

So walk towards the discomfort now, knowing that you are building an excellent foundation for your future self.
 
 Actionables 

 1  Iterate on your “elevator pitch” from week 3 and prepare your pitch for your meeting. You might want to adjust this pitch based on who you're meeting.

 2  Review your three short stories from week 3 and have them ready to go. Make sure they’re applicable to the person you’re meeting, and that they showcase your strengths and interests.
 
 3  Prepare five questions. Consider questions that are about them, the company, and about you. Below are some questions you can ask, but in a 20-minute coffee, you’ll most likely only get to a few. Review the following examples, then pick your top five.
Questions about them. Spend at least 30 minutes scanning the web for anything that your contact has posted online. Google for blog posts. Check Twitter. Look on Linkedin. Try to prepare questions that are more specific than “Tell me about a day in your job?” Here are a few examples:
I see that you worked on [project]. What did you love about it? Did you feel like you learned a lot?
I see you’ve worked in _____ for _____ years. How has your role changed since you started? What are you most proud of?
When you decided to leave [previous company] and join [current employer], what drove that decision?
How did you get your current position? (If they applied: What made you decide to apply when you did?)
 
Questions on the company. The culture of a company can be just as important as the salary and benefits. Write down questions to learn more about what it’s like to actually work there, and think about what values are most important to you at your new job. Here are some example questions:
I hear that working in [type of company] is rewarding because [expectation]. What has your experience been like?
How does the company pay compare to market rate?
I find I do well in competitive environments. What’s that like at your company? How does your company reward employees who exceed expectations?
I do my best work in environments that are more collaborative than competitive. How would you describe the environment in your company? How much does it vary from team to team? 
How do features get implemented at your company? Who can give input on a project’s direction? Are developers able to provide feedback on a product level?
Does your company have any programs focused on developer growth, like mentorship, bag lunches, etc.?
 
Ask for help. You don’t want to ask them for a job, but you do want to tell them about your situation and see if there are ways they might be able to help you. Here are some questions you might ask:
I’ve been really frustrated with the job search. Here’s what I’ve done so far [short summary of what you’ve done]. What more should I be doing?
I would love to work at your company at some point. If I wanted a position in a year, what are some things I can do to stand out as a candidate?
I’ve spent a lot of time learning, including [short summary of things you’ve been learning], and I’m wondering if I’m focusing on the right things. Given where your company’s headed, what would you recommend I level up in?
Since I don’t have a CS degree, I’m worried I won’t stand out as a great candidate. If you were in my shoes, what are some thing you’d do to give yourself the best chance of getting a position as a [role you're looking for] in the next few months?
 4  The day before the meeting, prepare for your meeting. Make sure to do the following: 
Map out your route to the meeting place. Plan to leave 15 minutes earlier than you think you need to.
 
Pick an outfit and try it on. Is it clean? Is it wrinkled? Is it comfortable? Do I look like a mature individual who is well-organized and takes good care of themselves? If you’re meeting with a developer, you generally don’t want to be too overdressed. If you’re not sure what to wear, look at the company’s website of the person you’re meeting, and see if you can match their general style.
 
Get your laptop prepared in case you need to pull it out to show a project or look something up. Make sure that it is fully charged, and that you’ve closed out of any applications or windows (especially ones that autoplay or that could be embarrassing if it pops up on the screen!). Put your laptop in a messenger bag or briefcase if you have one with the power cord and mouse. Take a moment to cover up or remove any inappropriate or objectionable stickers on the outside. If you have projects you might want to show them, have the code ready and the site loaded in a tab.
 
Say your elevator pitch in the mirror 10 times, or until it’s boring. When it’s boring, you’ve mastered it! Bonus tip: To get even more comfortable, try practicing your pitch while you’re doing some routine task, like washing the dishes. You probably won't end up reciting it word for word at your coffee, but if you know it by heart, then you’ll find it easier to respond to the vague and awkward command, “So tell me about yourself.”
 
Write down three things that make you a great hire. Put this in your wallet or laptop bag.
 
Bring a notebook. It’s totally ok to jot down notes during your conversation. So bring a notebook and a working pen.
 
Get to the coffee shop, or wherever you’re meeting, early and grab a seat for the two of you. If you plan on ordering something, get there a bit earlier, in case there’s a long line. Consider asking the person you’re meeting what they’d like and ordering for them, so you can spend your time talking instead of standing in line.

 5  On the day of the meeting, before you walk in the door, take some deep breaths. Review your three reasons why you would be an awesome hire.

 6  Within 15 minutes after your meeting -- take notes! Even if you were taking notes during the conversation, there are probably things you missed, or takeaways you want to capture. Before you forget all of the helpful things that you learned, sit down with a piece of paper and a pen, or open an email to yourself. Spend 5 minutes writing bullet points about your discussion.
What do you like about this person’s job?
 
What do you like about their company?
 
What did you learn about their hiring process?
 
What skills do you need to focus on to be an asset to this employer?
 
Did any part of the conversation surprise you? Were there any deal breakers that made you no longer interested in this company? Was there anything that left you with a gut feeling of unease? 
 
Which questions that you asked were most helpful? Make a note to ask these again in future coffee chats.
 
Which questions didn’t work as well as you had hoped? Make a note to skip these next time.
 
What was their reaction to your story? Was there anything they wanted to learn more about? Anything that made them confused or skeptical? Use this information to adjust and refine your pitch and your three stories for the future.
 
What feedback did they give you about your skills? Did they make helpful suggestions of what you might want to do differently, or can work on? Anything they were impressed by?
 
Based on their feedback, how do you feel about your prospects of getting a job at their company (or a similar company) in the near future? 
 7  Send a thank-you email within two days of meeting. State your name, say thank you, and mention one thing you learned that you’re especially appreciative of. Bonus: Find a relevant piece of content that your contact might be interested in, especially if you talked about it during your coffee, and include it in your note.

### Step 6: Resume Prep

* Goal: Revise your resume and get feedback

* Useful Links: (Technical Skills List)[https://www.thebalance.com/technical-skills-list-2063775]

```

Homework 
 
Learn what makes a good technical resume and use this knowledge to improve yours.
 
 Instructions 

 1  Open up an editable version of your resume. Most job applications will require a non-LinkedIn resume at some point in the application process. So make sure to have a version of your resume that you can print out. Open up that document and get ready to make some updates.

 2  Grab those job descriptions from the first mission. Model your resume to mirror the same keywords and phrases found in those job descriptions. While you should tailor your resume to each job that you apply for, this technique will give you a good baseline to start from.
 
 3  Highlight hard skills. Your “hard skills” are the technical skills you have and how you’ve used them on the job. But it's not about listing a bunch of tools and technologies, it's about describing how you’ve solved technical or business problems with those tools and technologies.

Employers are looking for these skills above all others. Make sure your hard skills are at the top of your resume in a “Qualifications Summary” or “Professional Qualifications” section. Here are two examples:
https://resumegenius.com/resume-samples/web-developer-resume-example

https://www.blueskyresumes.com/free-resume-samples/software-developer-resume-sample/view/

 4  Review your work history section. This section may focus on your volunteering, apprenticeships, hackathons, or paid work. Make it as coding-focused as possible. As you review your project/company titles and bullet points, ask yourself: Does this content present any of my “hard skills”? If not, revise.

 5  Frame skills in terms of quantifiable deliverables. Now that your work history is coding-focused, let’s try to quantify your achievements. Employers love this. Here’s how:
Review your lists of job duties. For each bullet point, open with an action verb, such as “achieved”, “delivered”, “gained”, “produced”, or “improved”. 
Next, describe your work using numbers. For example:
😐 Maintained corporate website -> 😀 Achieved 99% uptime for company X’s intranet services
😐 Contributed to app development -> 😀 Cut app load time by 80% by refactoring two features
😐 Assisted with quality assurance -> 😀 Designed test suites and ran simulations in Apple’s Test Flight system with 10 test users
 6  Now cut your content down to one page. Few people will read more than one page. Here are a few ways to make sure your content is succinct and high-impact.
Focus on tangibles (your coding skills and projects). If you’re unsure about a sentence, ask yourself: Does this demonstrate my core coding competencies? If not, consider cutting it.
 
If you have selected a job to apply for, be sure to use the employer’s keywords from the job description to describe your strengths. Copying is a good thing! The goal is to make sure that automated resume scanners will identify you as a qualified candidate.
 7  Review your layout. Now that your content is solid, let's make sure it's easy to read and presentable. 
Could you use bullets to make things more skimmable?
Do your subheadings, dates, and lists have consistent formatting?
Are your fonts (and other stylistic choices!) legible and easy to read?
 8  Proofread your text. The last thing you want on your shiny new resume is a typo! Use these steps to make sure everything looks good. 
Walk away from your work for a day, then begin proofreading
Use a spell checker to catch obvious errors
Print your resume, or display it at a magnified size, and read slowly
Double check dates, company names, and keywords.
If you have a job description handy, review it. Have you addressed the qualifications listed on the job ad? Have you used similar terminology to describe your own skills? If you’re not sure, try a service like Job Scan. Job Scan compares your resume text to job ad text. Then, Job Scan tells you what you’re missing.
 9  Send your resume to two people for review, and include the job description you’ve tailored your resume to. Ask them to provide feedback within five days.
Ask: “Were any parts of my resume confusing?”
Ask: “What do you think my main skills are?”
Ask: “Based on the job description, how well do I fit into this role?”
 10  Make changes to your resume according to feedback, then proofread again. Once you’re done updating your resume, revisit your LinkedIn profile and see if you can apply those resume changes to your profile.

 Examples 
View these examples of an entry-level IT developer resume, a web developer resume, and a technical support resume, and read about what makes the worst technical resume.

 PROTIP 
How to quantify your skills. Often, we’re fulfilling duties that someone else defines for us. It can be easy to lose sight of our value in the big picture. But when writing a resume, you want to connect those duties back to the big picture, so your future employer can see how valuable you’d be to the company. To get you started, ask yourself the following questions:
Who uses the product you worked on?
What can the user or company do now that they couldn’t do before you joined the project?
Did you improve output somehow? Can you quantify it? 
Did you help someone save money or time? 
Think in units. Can you describe your achievements in terms of dollars, hours, days, months, users, departments, features, tests, merges, deployments, acceptances, commits, or reviews?

```

### Step 7: Update your portfolio

* Goal: Pick three projects and include them in your portfolio

* Useful Links: (https://skillcrush.com/2015/03/12/impressive-tech-portfolio/)[More Useful tips on building a Portfolio]

```
 Homework 
 
Completed coding projects effectively illustrate the results of your coding education, whether formal or self-taught. You've invested in your coding skills, now it's time to show it to potential employers. Create or update your portfolio to show off your skills.
 
 Instructions 

 1  Pick a place to showcase your work. If you don’t have an online home for your portfolio yet, here are a few places to consider:
GitHub Pages - You can show previews of web development work using GitHub pages for free.
 
Your own website - You could use Bootstrap or a WordPress theme if you have some coding skills and time to build a site. For an even quicker website, try Wix or SquareSpace and use an out-of-the-box solution. Both sites are hosted, so you don’t have to set up your own hosting, and they offer quick and easy templates to build your site quickly.
 2  Choose three projects that demonstrate the skills you want to showcase to potential employers. Keep in mind everything you’ve learned from your coffees (informational interviews), your job description research, your top companies, etc. and use that information to decide what projects to highlight.
 
 3  Put these three projects on GitHub or on your own website. If you have not yet posted your most relevant projects, do that now. If you have content online already, take 20 minutes to review it. Use the following questions to help you:
Is your portfolio easy to navigate?
Do you have screenshots?
Do you have source code?
Is your source code clean and, when appropriate, commented?
Do you still understand it?
Are you prepared to talk about this project in an interview setting? 
 4  Include a brief description for each project. List the languages, frameworks, and tools that you used. Make sure this description is placed in an obvious location near the title of your project. Recruiters and potential employers are likely to come to your portfolio with a checklist of skills that they want to see. Make it easy for them to choose you!

 5  Prepare to talk about your portfolio. Having a portfolio ready for people to see is great, but it’s also a great opportunity for you to review the work you’ve done and be ready to talk about them. Be prepared to provide details on the whys and hows. Why did you pick this framework/language/tool? How did you make the main feature work? In coding, there are many ways to do things, so how did you pick yours?

 6  Describe two technical challenges you faced while building each project. If you’re trying to find your first tech job, chances are, the projects you’ve made so far probably won’t blow employers away. And that's ok! Because you don’t have a ton of experience (yet!), what you want to focus on is your potential. So make sure to describe the journey of creating these projects. Think of at least two technical challenges you faced and describe how you solved them. What was your solution? If you faced technical challenges you’re hoping to tackle in your future job, make sure to describe those on your site.

 7  Add your portfolio URL to your LinkedIn, GitHub, your Twitter profile, and wherever else you talk about your work or where you think potential employers might see it. Make it easy to find.

 BONUS MISSION  Post previews of two projects on LinkedIn, like this:


 EXAMPLES  Check out these example portfolios:
Mendel Bakaleynik (GitHub)
Alex Gorischek (website)
Molly Jameson (website)

 PROTIPS 
If you’re not sure how your portfolio compares to those of other junior developers, look for alumni websites from bootcamps. Checkout their portfolios. Analyze both style and skillset. What do you like? What might you have forgotten to mention? What have you done differently? What makes your portfolio memorable? 
 
Keep it simple. Design work can be intimidating and a time suck. The good news is, you don’t need to create a trendy, flashy website to prove that you’ve got the skills to do the job. Stick to one or two colors, and one or two fonts. Vary the font using bold, italics, underline, and different font sizes. Focus on content and usability. Ask for peers to review your website after you have the basics laid down.


```

### Step 8: Interview Prep

* Prepare to talk about your coding skills in an interview

* Useful Links: (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/before-you-code-remember-to-prep-for-your-coding-interview-2ccfb58147db)[Prepping for Whiteboard Interviews], (https://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/how-to-get-unstuck-during-a-pair-programming-interview)[Getting Unstuck During Whiteboard Interviews]

```

Homework 
 
Interviews can be intimidating. It feels like you’re being graded, and you hope that you’re saying the right thing. But here’s a different way of looking at interviews that might help -- your goal isn’t to get all the right answers, it’s simply to educate the interviewer about a subject you’re guaranteed to know way better than them: you!

If you’ve moved on to the interviewing stage, the company knows enough to think you might be a good fit. Now, it’s time to help them fill in the blanks. The interview process can be a lengthy one, so follow the instructions below to help you navigate the journey.
 
 Instructions 

 1  Confirm what type of interview it is. If you’re unsure, reach out to your contact at the company and ask them what to expect and how to best prepare. Proceed accordingly:

a. If this is a phone screen, prepare a space where you can work on your computer during the call. Phone screens tend to be more about your resume and your overall skills, but you may be asked to solve a brief coding problem, so make sure you have your computer ready.

b. If this is a technical interview, schedule time at least a week ahead to start working on practice problems. Project Euler, Hacker Rank and Interview Cake are great places to find practice problems. Check out the Bonus Reading section for more information on two common types of technical assessments: whiteboard interviews and pair-programming interviews.

c. Is there a take-home assignment after the interview? Prepare to dedicate time to complete this challenge. It may require a few hours or a few days.

 2  Compare your skills vs. the employer’s needs. Print out a copy of your resume. Print out a copy of the job description. Grab a highlighter or a marker. Look at the job description and highlight the top deliverables that the employer has named. If there are no deliverables, look for the top skills required. What examples do you have that demonstrate that you’re a great fit for this role? Make sure to have talking points ready to illustrate how good of a match you are.
 
 3  Prepare to explain your top two projects that are relevant to this job. Review them in your portfolio. You may be asked to present it, or even show some code. How would you explain these projects to a 5-year-old? What problem were you trying to solve? What obstacles did you face? How did you overcome them? Practice saying your answers out loud. 
 
 4  Address your limitations honestly. Go back to the job description. Circle any skills or phrases that could cause problems. Are there gaps in your skills? If so, do you have related skills? For example, could you produce a similar output using a different framework? Are you interested in learning new skills for this role? How would you do it? Now how can you take those limitations and gaps and speak about them confidently? Have a plan on how you’ll fill in those gaps (or even begin to level up beforehand) and be ready to talk about it during your interview. 

 5  Do some research on the employer. Make sure to read up on the company, the product, and the team. Here are a few things to consider: 
How large is this company?
How long have they been in business?
If this is a startup, what stage are they in? Did they recently raise any money?
Search for news about this company. Any big name hires? Any recent layoffs? Any transitions or big announcements they’ve made recently, especially any that may affect the job you’re applying for?
Who leads this company? Who leads your team? What other teams/staff are mentioned on the website? 
Check out some reviews on Glassdoor. They’re not always accurate, but the employee reviews may inspire some excellent questions to ask during your interview.
 6  Write down a final list of questions (at least 3) that you want to ask during your interview. Try to prepare at least 1 question in the following three categories:  
Technical question about the product or role A popular one is the simple, “What does success look like in this role?” If you’re able to learn more about the product, jot down more technical questions based on your research. Check out the company’s blog for recent technical announcements or new feature. Ask why they chose a particular framework, or what’s been their biggest technical challenge so far.
 
Business question about how the tech impacts that company Even if the job you're going for is strictly technical, it’s important to demonstrate that you’re excited to contribute to the overall business goals. Ask about how the product you'd be working on impacts the bottom line, or what pain points the newest features are going to solve for customers. Show that you value the company as a whole, and understand that you’re part of a team.
 
Personal question about the interviewer Making a connection with the person interviewing you is always a good thing. If you know who you’re speaking to ahead of time (always ask for names before your interview), do some research and come up with a few questions based on what you find. If you don’t know who you’re speaking to, ask about how they got started at the company and navigated their own tech career. If nothing else comes from the interview, at least you'll get some career advice!

 7  Try on your interview outfit a few days ahead. Make sure everything fits. Is it clean? Does it need to be steamed or ironed? Do you have matching shoes? Does the outfit vibe with the place you’re going to? If you’re interviewing at a financial institution, you might have the dress up more than if you’re walking into a tech startup.

 8  Check out the neighborhood early, if you can. Or at the very least, check out traffic patterns using Google Maps. Will you be traveling during a busy period? Be sure to leave sufficient time to travel.

 9  Prepare your laptop. You may be asked to use your personal laptop for technical questions or portfolio review, or you might just think of something during the conversation that you want to show. Either way, it's good to be prepared! Tidy your desktop. Close browser windows. Clean your keyboard and screen. Make sure your battery is fully charged.

 9  Get your things together the night before. Prepare a pen and notebook, and write down some bulleted notes on: your top skills, top projects, and questions for the employer. Place these notes with your laptop the night before your interview.

 10  On the day of the interview, take deep breaths before you walk in. When you’re sitting, you can fold your hands in your lap to prevent fidgeting. Sit tall and relax your shoulders. If you draw a blank, ask for clarification. If you need a moment to think, say “I need a moment to think about that.” Look down and compose your thoughts. Try again. At the end, thank the interviewer for their time.

 11  Take notes again! After your interview, take notes on what you learned about the job.

 12  Follow up. Send an email within 24 hours thanking the interviewer for meeting with you. If the interview went well, a simple thank-you for their time is great! If it didn’t go as well as you’d hoped, don’t despair. Use the follow-up email to address any additional concerns, provide links to make your case, or clear up any confusion. If you don’t have your interviewer’s email address, ask your contact at the company for their information.

 PROTIP 

Be mindful of your self-talk. Remember: this is not a test where you prove, once and for all, whether you are worthy or unworthy of a good job. This is not a test that proves whether your new coding skills are valuable. This is an opportunity to help someone connect the dots. Focus on connecting your skills to their needs. Point A to point B. You can do this!



```

### Step 9: Navigating Outcomes

* Goal: Dealing w/ job search outcomes

```
Homework 
 
There are two possible outcomes of a job search: an offer or a rejection. You will experience both. The reality of the job search is that there's a lot of rejection, especially when you’re just getting started and looking for your first job in tech. It’s perfectly normal and it’s part of the process, but it’s still hard to deal with.

But when you do finally get an offer, it’s awesome! You’ll feel validated and relieved, but the process isn’t completely over. You’ll have to evaluate the offer and decide if you want to accept it.

I’ll help you navigate both of these outcomes in the instructions below. 
 
 Instructions 

When you get rejected:

 1  Take a moment to feel how you feel. Job searching is surprisingly emotional, and rejection is the hardest part. I’m not going to tell you to shrug it off. If you feel disappointed, hurt, sad, take a moment to embrace those feelings. Cry it out. Call a friend and vent it out. Go to the gym, and kick-box it out. You have the right to feel frustrated.

 2  Reality check. One thing that helps deal with rejection is a reality check. No matter how many rejections you get, you only need one “yes”. There are hundreds of people who apply to one job post, and only one person gets it. No matter how awesome you are, there are many variables outside of your control that end up with them not picking you. All that is to say this: it’s not you, it’s the process. You’re allowed to be frustrated, but use this reality check to fight back against any internalization of this rejection. Take a deep breath and say it with me: It’s not you, it’s the process. This “no” just got you one step closer to your “yes.” 
 
 3  Reflect on your application. Reach out to your contact at that company to figure out why you were rejected. Most likely, you won’t get a response, but it doesn’t hurt to try. The further you got in the process, the more likely you are to get a response. If you don’t hear back, see if you can find out who did get that position and look into their background. Is there an obvious thing they had that you didn’t? Is there something you might be able to work on in the future? If you got to the interview stage, review your notes. Did you jot down anything that could help you improve your chances of an offer in the future? While it’s helpful to reflect and learn from the past, don’t spend too much time on this step. Budget maybe an hour or two. There are many reasons why someone else got the offer over you, so without direct feedback, it’s hard to have a clear answer. However, if you’ve had a few rejections, it’s worth looking into what they have in common. Is it the particular job title you’re going for? The type of company? If there are any patterns, it might be helpful to reexamine your job search strategy and make adjustments.
 
 4  Get back to work. It’s tough to bounce back, but you have to get back up. So revisit some of the past missions. Go back to those meetups. Have more coffees. Use Twitter to look for job openings. Make friends in your local tech community. Keep coding, keep building, and keep working on your tech skills. There’s a lot to do, and there’s no time to waste. It’s a numbers game, so keep going! 


When you get an offer:

 1  Celebrate! Look back on all the tasks you’ve completed on your journey, and take a moment to appreciate how far you've come. Tell someone. Tell us! Tweet us at @CodeNewbies and we’ll celebrate with you. Get ready for GIFs :)

 2  Review your notes from your interactions with this company. Okay, time to get serious. What did you like about the job? What are your expectations for career growth? Ignore whether the company thinks they’re great. They have to say that. Do you think this is a job where you will grow? Do they value the skills that you bring to the table? Do you see this as, at the very least, a stepping stone? Will the job offer more than it consumes (think: hours, emotional energy, commute time)? Does it give you what you need from a job? 

 3  Are there any deal breakers? Take a good look at your situation. Can you afford a longer job search, or do you need something right now? Not everyone is in a position to turn down an offer of employment, but it’s still a good idea to reflect on any absolute deal breakers that may have cropped up during the application process. Remember, jobs can come and go, but the costs of getting into a toxic, unsafe, or unethical work environment may be long-lasting. 

 4  Do you have any follow-up questions? Are you clear on who you would work with? Do you know who you would report to? Were you able to meet them? Would you want to request a tour of the space so you can see where and how the team works? Any final questions on your mind that would help you make a decision? 

 5  Are there any red flags? Is there high turnover? Are there signs of growth or transition? Look at the job ads on the company’s website. How many people are on the team you would be joining? How many positions are open on that team? Were there any topics that the employer did not address directly? Feel-good talk and employee perks are nice, but you need to protect your own interests. If something that is important to you was not addressed to your satisfaction, you can ask for more information. This is in everyone’s best interests. Hiring is expensive. Being honest about your needs prevents future strain for you and the employer.

 6  Write a list of pros and cons. Which side is longer? For greater clarity, you could rank your pros and cons from most to least important. Just number them. Are we seeing a clear picture yet?

 7  Consider negotiating. One counter-offer is normal. Many employers expect it. They may be giving a low salary offer up front because they expect you to come back with a higher request. If you’re unsure, look for information about salaries for your career on Dice or Glassdoor. 

 8  Draft your response to the employer. Consult this sample acceptance and rejection letter to use as a template.

 9  Proofread your response, and....Send it!

 13  Celebrate again! Whether or not you’ve decided to take this offer, this is still a win. Congrats!

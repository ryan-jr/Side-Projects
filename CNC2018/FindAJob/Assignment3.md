Explainers
```

Prepare a short pitch(2 - 3 sentences):

* Pitch should be about yourself as it relates to your coding goals.

* The ideal is to present yourself as a great candidate for a possible position(so craft your story around this concept/idea)

Good:

```
I'm currently a developer, hoping to get a new role working with JavaScript.  Before that I taught high school English for 10 years.

* The above example frames you as a developer with a story/past life

```

Needs work:

```
I was a high school English teacher for ten years and learned how to code about seven months ago.  I've been learning JavaScript through an online program, and I'm currently looking for my first postion.

* The above pitch frames you as a student looking for their first break, when you want to present yourself as job ready
```

Good:
```

I'm currently a developer hoping to get a new role working with JavaScript.  Befor that I taught high school English for ten years which helped me solve tough problems, because if you can figure out how to settle down a bunch of rowdy teenagers and care about grammar you can take on any Bug.

* This connects your past life and shows how skills from that background connect to what you want to get into

```

Stories:

* For your stories, think back on the skills that showed up most frequently during your job descritpion search.  Of these, pick the ones you want to highlight in your conversations.  

* Now think of three stories that demonstrate you have these skills

* The goal in preparing the short stories is to see what people are interested in, what they ask questions about, and what you can do better commnicate your abilities.  So pick stories that you want to highlight the best parts of things.

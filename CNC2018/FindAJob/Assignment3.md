Explainers
```

Prepare a short pitch(2 - 3 sentences):

* Pitch should be about yourself as it relates to your coding goals.

* The ideal is to present yourself as a great candidate for a possible position(so craft your story around this concept/idea)

Good:

```
I'm currently a developer, hoping to get a new role working with JavaScript.  Before that I taught high school English for 10 years.

* The above example frames you as a developer with a story/past life

```

Needs work:

```
I was a high school English teacher for ten years and learned how to code about seven months ago.  I've been learning JavaScript through an online program, and I'm currently looking for my first postion.

* The above pitch frames you as a student looking for their first break, when you want to present yourself as job ready
```

Good:
```

I'm currently a developer hoping to get a new role working with JavaScript.  Befor that I taught high school English for ten years which helped me solve tough problems, because if you can figure out how to settle down a bunch of rowdy teenagers and care about grammar you can take on any Bug.

* This connects your past life and shows how skills from that background connect to what you want to get into

```

Stories:

* For your stories, think back on the skills that showed up most frequently during your job descritpion search.  Of these, pick the ones you want to highlight in your conversations.  

* Now think of three stories that demonstrate you have these skills

* The goal in preparing the short stories is to see what people are interested in, what they ask questions about, and what you can do better commnicate your abilities.  So pick stories that you want to highlight the best parts of things.

Questions:

* Make a list of questions you want to ask, and information you hope to get at the event.  See if there are developers from companies you want to work at, and try and ask questions of them.  

* Having a clear list of questions, and list of people that you want to talk to(if one is available) can help you make the most of your time at an event.

At the event:

* Participate in at least 2 distinct converations (See below on "How to Network"), if you meet someone you want to follow up with, see if they have a business card, if not get their contact email/linked in/twitter (some way to keep in contact with them).  

* Make sure you have something to take notes with, small notebook/pen.

After the event:

* What 3 things went well?

* What 3 things you said whent talking about yourself worked well?

* What 3 things did not go well/as well as expected?

* What 3 things did you say that did not work/didn't resonate?  What might you change about them?

* What 3 people/companies/ideas do you want to follow up on?


Notes:

* You don't need to be perfect to make connections.

* Ask open ended questions(not yes/no questions)(e.g. How do you feel about..., What has your experience been with...)

* To start conversation you can catch up on some tech news and ask people if they've heard about it/their thoughts on it.

## How to Network:

A.  1 on 1 conversations

* Find spaces where people congregate(usually near food)

* Make eye contact and introduce yourself(e.g. "Hey, I don't think I've met you yet, my name is X")

* Provide topics to open the conversation(e.g. "Hi, I'm X, what brings you to (Name of event)? or Hi I'm X, how long have you been (doing thing/event)")

* Try and drive the conversation toward the event that you two are attending (AKA: The thing you have in common)(e.g. "Hi I'm X, what do you think of the talks so far", or "It's my first time here, what about you?")

B. Joining a group conversation

* Approach near an opening, if the group momentarily stops speaking and looks your way, introduce yourself(E.g. "Hi everyone I'm X, how's everyone liking the event so far?")

* If the group doesn't break off conversation/look your way, try and make eye contact with someone who's disengaged from the group, this is a good point/spot to start up a side conversation.

* Once you've identified the topic of group conversation, contribute positive comments in a small way to alert people to your presence.  Things like "Great", "Congratulations", and "Neat" often work well here.

* Interject short questions to the main person speaking in the group if you get a chance (E.g "How did you do that?", "When did that happen?", "How did you come up with that?")

* If there's space for a larger interjection engage with the main speaker by asking for more information ("You know that's interesting, I've always wondered about that, Can you tell me more about that/how you did that?", "How long have you been a part of company/project", "Sounds like you love your job, what's the best part?", "That's an impressive project, how did you get started?")

# Code More

A.  I was able to iterate/get feedback quickly.  There was clear direction/project layout with a clear goal.  I was able to complete the project within a reasonably quick amount of time. Yes.  

B.  I liked it because it was a challenge, but not something that I was going to be overwhelmed by because it was a clear goal.  I consistently worked on it through a weekend, and learned a ton.  I also liked it because it was a field that I'm interested in (sentiment analysis).  

C.  I was unhappy with how little support I felt I had.  I was unhappy with how vauge the endgoal was.  I was unhappy with the lack of planning/benchmarks/timelines.  I didn't fully understand Flask/Django in order to complete the project so it rushed it.  

D.  For me, that means understanding how to write an API and effectively interact with it.  Be a full stack web developer from Python, to Django/Flask to JS.  

E.  Write an API, understand how to host something on Heroku/for a hackathon, having my own portfolio site beyond github pages.

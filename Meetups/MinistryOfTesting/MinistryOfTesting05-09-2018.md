# Testing frameworks/companies

- The question/tradeoff (how long is support viable)
- OpenSTF (for android) allows for creating a virtual device farm (free)
- Even if something isn't supported it will likely still work, but it will probably have UI issues
- Having good progressive enhancements is a good idea/way to go (have a message if not supporting JS)
- You can use Charles to attempt/proxy web throttling
- TESTING THERAPY SESSION!!!
- Risk assessment testing (Fuzzing etc...)
- Scaffolding/Templating in JS
- Frisbe JS (Performance/API testing) and gatling for load testing (Faker = random string generator)
- pact.io for other testing stuff
- Websocket testing?
- Testing a workflow/forms etc... Have a cookie set up and then run a bunch of the tests
- Track JS
- Google analytics/custom stuff for analytics 
- Kabania/Data dog for monitoring
- Run JS for counting in the head for tracking/analytics
- You need business buy in/top down in order to get things to change, also good communication etc.. REALLY HELPS

# Planning and Outline Doc



### The project must follow/allow for these user stories




```

Design Inspiration: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA

User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.

User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

```


### Project Planning

```
HTML/CSS
- Design Basis: Iphone Calculator
- Needs to be responsive
- Need assets for various buttons
	- Calcuation Window

	- Buttons: 
	- Top Row: AC, +/-, Div
	- Next Row: 7, 8, 9, Multiplication
	- Next Row: 4, 5, 6, Subtraction
	- Next Row: 1, 2, 3, Addition
	- Next Row: 0, decimal, Equals



JS:
- Accept input via clicking on/selecting an HTML/CSS button identified via an ID (possibly a class?)
- That button needs to display out put to the calculation window(e.g. display the last number/operation pressed)
- If multiple numbers are pressed in succession that number needs to become larger and display in the calcualation window
- If it is possible when equal is pressed complete the operation
- Decimal numbers need to also be considered
MVP:
- Get a calculator that add, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two numbers

Steps to MVP:
- See JS steps above
- Put all selections clicked on into an array that is executed sequentially when the equals button is clicked
- 



Day 1:
- Gather all necessary assets
- Start on the layout/design work

Day 2:
- Attempt to wire the JS to the HTML buttons

Day 3:
- Get the calculation window to display the clicked button

Day 4:
- Get larger numbers working/showing up in the calculation window
